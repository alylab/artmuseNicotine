Welcome to artmusePatient! Thanks for checking out the code.

The task files "artmusePatient.m" and "artmusePatient_practice.m" need to be in the same folder as the "stimuli" and "practiceStimuli" folders. Both scripts will require you to enter a subject number as well as subject initials. These files will output a ".mat" and ".txt" result files as well as print the behavioral results into the command window. When you have run through the task, you can place the two output files into the "data" folder.

Within this folder you will find "data_dictionary.rtf" which details the variables at the header column for the ".txt" file outputted by "artmusePatient.m" and "artmusePatient_practice.m".

The individual subject files that were used for data analysis can be found in the "data" folder.

If you run into any issue or have any questions, feel free to reach out to Nicholas Ruiz at nar2160@columbia.edu. Thank you!
